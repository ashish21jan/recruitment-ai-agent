## Security Considerations

### API Key Protection
- Environment variable storage (not hardcoded)
- Git ignore rules to prevent accidental commits
- Template file for easy setup without exposing secrets

### Input Validation
- File type restrictions (PDF, DOCX only)
- File count limits (maximum 10 resumes)
- Content sanitization for display

### Error Handling
- Graceful failure for file processing errors
- Fallback evaluations for processing failures
- User-friendly error messages

## Performance Characteristics

### Processing Times
- Single resume evaluation: ~3-5 seconds
- 10 resume batch: ~30-60 seconds
- JD generation: ~5-10 seconds
- File extraction: <1 second per file

### Scalability Considerations
- Synchronous processing (suitable for 1-10 users)
- Can be enhanced with:
  - Background task queues (Celery, Redis)
  - Database caching (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
  - Load balancing for multiple instances

## Cost Analysis

### Free Tier Usage
- Google Gemini API: Generous free tier for development
- FastAPI: Open source, no licensing costs
- Deployment: Can start with free hosting (Heroku, Railway)

### Production Costs
- API calls: ~$0.01-0.05 per resume evaluation (varies by model)
- Hosting: $5-20/month for basic VPS
- Domain: $10-15/year

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Case: Small to Medium Recruitment
- HR teams evaluating 10-50 candidates per position
- Startup founders screening applicants
- Recruitment agencies with multiple clients

### Extended Use Cases
- Internal promotion candidate evaluation
- Contract/freelancer screening
- Internship application processing
- Conference speaker selection

## Integration Possibilities

### Future Enhancement Options
- **Email Services**: SendGrid, AWS SES for automated sending
- **ATS Integration**: Workday, Greenhouse, Lever APIs
- **Calendar Systems**: Google Calendar, Outlook for interview scheduling
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL for candidate history and analytics
- **Authentication**: OAuth2, JWT for multi-user access
- **Storage**: S3, GCS for resume archival

## Advantages Over Traditional Methods
