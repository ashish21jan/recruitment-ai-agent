## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Gemini API key ([Get one here](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or download the repository**
   ```bash
   cd recruitment_agent
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   copy .env.template .env

   # macOS/Linux
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file and add your Gemini API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

   **Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

5. **Generate test PDF files** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```
   This will create PDF versions of the test files and set up your .env file.

6. **Verify setup**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   You should see output indicating the server is running.

## ü§ñ AI Logic Explanation

### Resume Evaluation Process

1. **Text Extraction**: The application first extracts text content from uploaded PDF and DOCX files using specialized libraries (pypdf and python-docx).

2. **AI Analysis**: For each resume, the application sends a structured prompt to the Google Gemini API containing:
   - The complete job description
   - The extracted resume text
   - Instructions to evaluate the candidate

3. **Structured Response**: Gemini returns a JSON object for each candidate with:
   - `score`: Integer from 0-100 representing match quality
   - `missing_skills`: Array of skills from JD not found in resume
   - `remarks`: One-sentence explanation of the score

4. **Candidate Ranking**: Candidates are automatically ranked by their scores.

5. **Email Generation**: The application makes additional Gemini API calls to generate:
   - Personalized interview invitation for the best candidate
   - Professional rejection email template for other candidates

### Prompt Engineering

The application uses carefully crafted prompts that:
- Provide clear context about the evaluation task
- Request structured JSON output for reliable parsing
- Emphasize professional, objective evaluation criteria
- Generate empathetic, personalized communication

## üéØ Model Choice: Why Google Gemini?

### Reasoning for Gemini Selection

**Google Gemini** was selected as the AI model for this application due to several key advantages:

1. **Strong Natural Language Understanding**
   - Gemini excels at comprehending complex job descriptions and resumes
   - Accurately identifies skills, experience levels, and qualifications
   - Understands context and nuance in professional documents

2. **Structured Output Capability**
   - Reliably generates valid JSON responses when properly prompted
   - Critical for the scoring system requiring consistent data format
   - Reduces parsing errors and improves application stability

3. **Complex Instruction Following**
   - Can follow multi-step evaluation instructions
   - Balances multiple criteria (skills, experience, culture fit)
   - Adapts evaluation style based on job requirements

4. **Content Generation Quality**
   - Produces professional, personalized emails
   - Maintains appropriate tone and empathy
   - Generates contextually relevant content

5. **API Accessibility**
   - Well-documented Python SDK (google-generativeai)
   - Straightforward authentication and configuration
   - Generous free tier for development and testing

6. **Cost-Effectiveness**
   - Competitive pricing for production use
   - Good balance of quality and cost
   - Suitable for real-world recruitment scenarios

### Alternative Considerations

While Gemini was chosen, other models like OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, or open-source alternatives (Llama, Mistral) could also be viable depending on specific requirements around privacy, cost, or deployment constraints.

## üìÇ Example Files

The `/test_files` directory contains sample files for testing:

- **example_jd.txt/.pdf**: Sample job description for a Senior Software Engineer role
- **example_resume_1.txt/.pdf**: Sample resume with strong match (7 years experience)
- **example_resume_2.txt/.pdf**: Sample resume with moderate match (3 years experience)

Use these files to test the application functionality without needing to prepare your own documents.

**Note**: Run `python setup.py` to automatically generate PDF versions of the text files for testing file upload functionality.

## üîß API Endpoints

### Frontend Routes
- `GET /` - Home page with input form
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

### API Routes
- `POST /generate-jd` - Generate job description with AI
  - Request body: JSON with job parameters
  - Returns: Generated JD text

- `POST /extract-jd` - Extract text from JD file
  - Request body: multipart/form-data with file
  - Returns: Extracted JD text

- `POST /evaluate` - Evaluate candidates
  - Request body: multipart/form-data with JD text and resume files
  - Returns: HTML results page

## üîí Security Considerations

- **API Key Protection**: API key stored in `.env` file (not in version control)
- **File Validation**: Only PDF and DOCX files accepted
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs processed safely
- **File Size Limits**: Enforced by FastAPI configuration
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production for secure data transmission

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable is not set"
- **Solution**: Ensure `.env` file exists and contains valid API key

**Issue**: "Error extracting PDF/DOCX"
- **Solution**: Verify file is not corrupted and is a valid PDF/DOCX

**Issue**: "Failed to generate job description"
- **Solution**: Check internet connection and API key validity

**Issue**: Application won't start
- **Solution**: Verify all dependencies installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## üìà Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Database integration for storing evaluations
- User authentication and multi-tenant support
- Batch processing for large recruitment campaigns
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)
- Resume parsing with structured data extraction
- Interview scheduling integration
- Candidate comparison visualizations
