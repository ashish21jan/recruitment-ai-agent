# Test Files

This directory contains sample files for testing the Recruitment AI Agent.

## Files Included

### Job Description
- **example_jd.txt** - Sample job description for a Senior Software Engineer position

### Sample Resumes
- **example_resume_1.txt** - Strong candidate with relevant experience
- **example_resume_2.txt** - Moderate candidate with some missing skills

## Usage

These files can be used to test the application without needing to prepare your own documents. 

For testing:
1. You can paste the content from `example_jd.txt` directly into the job description text area
2. Create PDF versions of the resume text files using any PDF creator for upload testing
3. Or paste the resume contents to test the evaluation logic

## Note

These are simplified text versions for easy testing. In a real scenario:
- Job descriptions would be formatted documents (DOCX/PDF)
- Resumes would be professionally formatted PDFs or DOCX files
- Content would be more detailed and comprehensive
